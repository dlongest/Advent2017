    "# Advent of Code Day 19\n",
    "\n",
    "Day 19 is a straight-forward path walker.  Given a diagram, walk the path from start to finish, determining which letters are encountered (part one) or how many steps are taken (part two) prior to reaching the exit.  The path has a very simple rule: you always walk forward until you encounter a +, at which point there's one (and only one) way to turn to continue the walk.  The paths may cross each other but the + is the only signal that one should turn - it only takes a little effort to figure out the correct direction to turn at that point.  "
