    "For Day 18, we build a basic instruction processor.  For part one, there are a handful of instructions that just have to be implemented to manipulate some registers (held in a dictionary) with the goal of looking for a specific instruction to execute. Part two revises the nature of two instructions and requires building (in essence) a cheap multiprocessing.  The second part was tricky in terms of getting the coordination and termination conditions exactly right.  "

    "### Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2 was a challenge because it requires interleaving two distinct \"programs\" and finding a way for them to communicate.  I decided to use a Queue object for each program.  Each program also gets its own registers and instruction pointer.  Lastly, each needs to be able to communicate if it's completed its instructions or if its blocked.  The problem description mentions that the program should work correctly regardless of how you choose to run the programs.  I decided to have each program run up until the point it encountered a rcv instruction and its queue was empty.  At that point, its blocked and transfers execution to the other program.  Deadlocks can occur if both programs are blocked, or if one program is done and the other is blocked, in which event the combined program needs to terminate. "
